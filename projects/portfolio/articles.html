        Lavender for All Seasons: A Gardener’s Guide to Growing and Creating with Lavender Year-Round (Page 20)
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
         Book review, this one was marketed at both farmers and home growers and thus was an interesting read. Lavender is such an interesting plant because of its utility and this was such a neat book with beautiful photos. The photos inside were great inspiration for my own photography.

        Demystifying Cannabis Growing (Page 14-15)
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
       I picked this article for the same reasons as the another one, I have background with the topic. At first, it was stressful because I wanted to make sure my information was correct. Once I got writing, this became one of my favorite articles to write and currently stands as the piece I’m most proud of for the Summer of 2025.

        Cannabis Farming Book Review (Page 20)
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        When we were picking out books, this one stuck out to me. I have friends who partake in cannabis usage so I figured the background knowledge I had from them would make me the ideal reviewer for this book. I also believe that reporting is how we reduce stigmas and increase public understandings in topics like this. Overall the book was okay, it was marketed towards farmers rather than home growers which wasn’t something the audience of the magazine would seek out and I made sure to note that in my article.

        Ilana Rubin: Certified Nature and Forest Therapy Guide
        </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        This was a profile on forest therapy guide, Ilana Rubin. I wanted to participate in a forest bathing session but sadly there wasn’t enough time between when I received the article and when it was to be published, so we settled for a zoom call. Using what I learned from Clarence Williams JOUR320, I observed her background in the call and asked about it. She had this large tapestry depicting ducks in a lake with trees and mountains in the background. It could have easily been something I missed but according to her, it belonged to her mother and was a reminder of home. I thought what she said about it was beautifully sentimental and framed things perfectly for the upcoming interview.

        An article I wrote for the University of Maryland campus publication, La Voz Latina. This one came shortly after the election of President Donald Trump in 2024. The roundtable was a way for minority journalists to discuss how to move forward.
